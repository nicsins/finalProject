 * Represents a single dice (or 'die') in a program.

 * Class names are generally the singular form, Player, Card, Deck
 * Unless one object made from this class represents multiple things and the name needs to reflect that
 * DeckOfCards is a ok name (but Deck is arguably better)
 *
 * 'Dice' is also a valid singular form, as well as 'Die'
