/**
 *
 * Simple Knockout dice game. Fun for very small children learning to add up :)
 *
 * Players: 2 or more
 * Equipment: 2 dice
 *
 * GamePanel play:
 *
 * Each player picks their own knockout number: 6, 7, 8 or 9.
 *
 * Each player takes turns rolling two dice. If the total of their dice is their knockout number,
 * they are knocked out of the game.
 *
 * Play continues until only one player is left. The last player not knocked out is the winner.
